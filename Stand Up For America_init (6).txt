They look at their charts and numbers and beam with glee, all while cities are burning in the background. They do not care about America.\n\n<p style=\"font-family:Garamond;margin:-4px;font-size:17px\"> There is, however, one man who cares.\n\n<p style=\"font-family:Garamond;margin:-4px;font-size:13px;margin:4px\"> George Corley Wallace, the former Governor of Alabama, has the courage to stand up for America. He will fight tooth and nail to defeat the anarchists, the bureaucrats, the kooks, the communists, the hippies, all of them. He loves this country more than anything, and he will do anything to protect it. Even run for President in spite of the intellectuals desire to destroy him - and America at large.\n\n",
